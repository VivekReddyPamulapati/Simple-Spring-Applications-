# Simple-Spring-Applications-
This is a simple spring application that I have developed using the spring MVC, Hibernate, AOP concepts. This is just a simple CRM database, where you can Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)operatio


I have not included the Spring, Hibernate and aspectJ library files as they are available to download, just download the library files from their officila webiste and import these source file to run the application
